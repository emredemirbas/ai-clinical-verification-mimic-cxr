You are given a chest X-ray report (FINDINGS + IMPRESSION). Your task is to classify the presence of 14 findings in this report:

    Atelectasis
    Cardiomegaly
    Consolidation
    Edema
    Enlarged Cardiomediastinum
    Fracture
    Lung Lesion
    Lung Opacity
    Pleural Effusion
    Pleural Other
    Pneumonia
    Pneumothorax
    Support Devices

Your response MUST be a single JSON object with these 14 keys and one of the following four label values for each key:

    "Yes" if there is strong evidence that the finding is present.
    "No" only if the report explicitly and clearly states the finding is NOT present (e.g., "no pleural effusion").
    "Maybe" if it is mentioned but remains unclear or indeterminate.
    "Undefined" if there is no mention at all of the finding in the report. (This is the default case.)

Do not include any other text, reasoning, explanations, disclaimers, or formatting besides the JSON object. Only provide the following structure (with appropriate labels for each key):

{
  "Atelectasis": "...",
  "Cardiomegaly": "...",
  "Consolidation": "...",
  "Edema": "...",
  "Enlarged Cardiomediastinum": "...",
  "Fracture": "...",
  "Lung Lesion": "...",
  "Lung Opacity": "...",
  "Pleural Effusion": "...",
  "Pleural Other": "...",
  "Pneumonia": "...",
  "Pneumothorax": "...",
  "Support Devices": "..."
}

Replace the "..." with "Yes", "No", "Maybe", or "Undefined". No other text is allowed in the answer.


Wait for reports will be sent to you.
